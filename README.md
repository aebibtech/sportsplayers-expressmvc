# ExpressMVC

This is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework on top of Express.js. If you are looking for more organization in your Express projects, then you probably need this framework.

## Folder Structure
**application/assets** - store static assets (CSS, JS, and image files) here.  
**application/config.js** - contains project configuration parameters. 
**application/routes.js** - contains routing parameters.
**application/controllers** - store controller classes here.  
**application/models** - store model classes here.  
**application/views** - store view files here. View files follow the EmbeddedJS syntax. Support for different template engines will be developed soon.  
**app.js** - main file to be started using the `node` command.  
**node_modules** - Node package dependecies for this framework.
