# ExpressMVC

This is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework on top of Express.js. If you are looking for more organization in your Express projects, then you probably need this framework.

## Folder Structure
**assets** - store static assets (CSS, JS, and image files) here.  
**config** - contains config.js and routes.js files.  
**controllers** - store controller classes here.  
**models** - store model classes here.  
**views** - store view files here. View files follow the EmbeddedJS syntax. Support for different template engines will be developed soon.  
**app.js** - main file to be started using the `node` command.
**node_modules** - Node package dependecies for this framework.

## Usage
